# StreetNet
AI trained to play [country streaks on GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/country-streak). When placed in a random location on Google Street View, this neural network is tasked with predicting which country you are in.

To use, simply clone this repo, install the requirements (`requirements.txt` or `cuda_requirements.txt`) and run with python:
```bash
python streetnet.py [--use-cuda]
```
You can test StreetNet by playing a game of GeoGuessr, or by simply dropping into a random location on Google Maps!
